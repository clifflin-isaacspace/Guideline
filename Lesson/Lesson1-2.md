* Importing time package

```python 
import time
```
* Importing the `Robot` class for controlling JetBot

```python
from jetbot import Robot
```

* Initializing a class instance of `Robot`
  
```python
robot = Robot()
```

* In the preivous sample, we saw how we can control the robot using 
commands like `left`, `right`, etc. But what if we want to set 
each motor speed individually? Well, there are two ways you can 
do this.

* The first way is to call the `set_motors` method. For example, to 
turn along a left arch for a second, we couldset the left motor to
30% and the right motor to 60% like follows.

```python
print('Left arch 1')
robot.set_motors(0.3, 0.6)
time.sleep(1.0)
robot.stop()
```
                                    
* Great! You should see the robot move along a left arch. But actually,
there's another way that we could accomplish the same thing.

* The `Robot` class has two attributes named `left_motor` and `right_motor`
that represent each motor individually. These attributes are `Motor` 
class instances, each which contains a `value` attribute. This `value` 
attribute is a `traitlet` which generates events when assigned a new 
value. In the motor class, we attach a function that upates the motor 
commands whenever the value changes.

* So, to accomplish the exact same thing we did above, we could execute the
following.

```python
print('Left arch 2')
robot.left_motor.value = 0.3
robot.right_motor.value = 0.6
time.sleep(1.0)
robot.left_motor.value = 0.0
robot.right_motor.value = 0.0
```
